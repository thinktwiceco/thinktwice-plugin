# ThinkTwice Style Guide

A guide to the visual identity, emotional tone, and design philosophy that shapes how users experience ThinkTwice.

---

## The Concept

ThinkTwice exists in the space between impulse and intention. It's not a blocker or a barrier—it's a gentle pause button in a world of instant gratification.

### Core Philosophy

**Thoughtful Consumption Over Impulse Buying**

ThinkTwice intervenes at the moment of purchase, not to stop you, but to give you space. The design reflects this philosophy:

- **Non-judgmental**: We don't shame or block. We invite reflection.
- **Supportive**: Like a trusted friend asking "Are you sure?" not a parent saying "No."
- **Empowering**: You remain in control. We just help you think clearly.
- **Calm**: In a world of bright "Buy Now" buttons, we offer a moment of quiet consideration.

### The User Experience Feeling

When users interact with ThinkTwice, they should feel:

1. **Relieved** - "Finally, something that helps me pause instead of pushing me to buy"
2. **Empowered** - "I'm making a conscious choice, not being manipulated"
3. **Calm** - "This feels peaceful, not stressful"
4. **Trusted** - "This tool respects my autonomy and privacy"
5. **Thoughtful** - "I'm being invited to reflect, not rushed to decide"

The interface should never feel:

- Aggressive or pushy
- Judgmental or preachy
- Cluttered or overwhelming
- Corporate or salesy
- Anxious or urgent

## Color Palette & Emotional Meaning

### The Foundation: Deep Blue-Gray

**Background Colors**

- `#3d4f5e` - Main background
- `#4a5d6e` - Secondary background

**Feeling**: These deep, muted blue-grays evoke:

- **Stability** - Like a calm ocean or evening sky
- **Trust** - Professional but not corporate
- **Contemplation** - A space for reflection, not action
- **Sophistication** - Mature and thoughtful, not flashy

These colors create a **calm container** that feels separate from the bright, urgent Amazon page. It's a visual "breathing room" that signals: "This is a different kind of space—one for thinking, not buying."

### The Primary Action: Mint Green

**Primary Button Color**: `#b8d8d4`

**Feeling**: This soft mint green communicates:

- **Growth** - Like new leaves, suggesting positive change
- **Freshness** - A clean slate, a new perspective
- **Gentleness** - Soft and approachable, not aggressive
- **Hope** - The possibility of making better choices

This is the color of "Sleep on it"—the main action. It's not red (urgent) or orange (aggressive). It's the color of **patience** and **growth**. When users see this color, they should feel: "This is a good choice. This feels right."

**Text Color**: `#065F46` (Dark green)

- Provides contrast while maintaining the green theme
- Feels grounded and natural

### The Secondary Action: Soft Blue

**Secondary Button Color**: `#bfdbfe`

**Feeling**: This light, airy blue suggests:

- **Clarity** - Like a clear sky, helping you see things clearly
- **Calm Confidence** - "I know what I want"
- **Openness** - Not defensive, but open to possibilities
- **Peace** - A gentle, reassuring presence

This color is for "I need it"—acknowledging that sometimes, you do know what you want. It's supportive, not confrontational.

**Text Color**: `#223573` (Deep blue)

- Maintains the calm, confident feeling
- Professional but approachable

### The Tertiary Action: Soft Coral

**Tertiary Button Color**: `#fca5a5`

**Feeling**: This gentle coral-red conveys:

- **Gentle Caution** - Not alarm, but awareness
- **Self-Care** - "It's okay to say no"
- **Warmth** - Caring, not cold rejection
- **Strength** - The courage to make different choices

This is for "I don't need it"—a decision that requires courage but shouldn't feel harsh. It's warm and supportive, like a friend saying "You've got this."

**Text Color**: `#7F1D1D` (Deep red)

- Grounds the warmth with stability
- Feels decisive but not aggressive

### Text Colors: Clarity & Readability

**Light Text**: `#d1dce5`

- Soft, readable, and calming
- Feels like moonlight—gentle illumination
- High contrast against dark backgrounds without being harsh

**Dark Text**: `#2d3e4e`

- Grounded and trustworthy
- Professional but not cold
- Used in popup interfaces for clarity

### The Popup Interface: Clean & Neutral

**Popup Colors**: White (`#ffffff`), light grays (`#f9fafb`, `#e5e7eb`)

**Feeling**: The popup interface uses a clean, neutral palette that feels:

- **Professional** - Like a well-designed app
- **Trustworthy** - Clean and organized
- **Uncluttered** - Easy to scan and understand
- **Neutral** - Doesn't compete with the main overlay's emotional tone

This is the "settings" space—functional, clear, and straightforward.

### Error States: Clear but Not Alarming

**Error Color**: `#e74c3c`

**Feeling**: Errors should be:

- **Clear** - You know something went wrong
- **Not Panic-Inducing** - Mistakes happen, it's okay
- **Actionable** - Here's what to do about it

## Typography Feeling

**Font**: Inter

**Why**: Inter feels:

- **Modern but timeless** - Not trendy, will age well
- **Highly readable** - Designed for screens
- **Friendly but professional** - Approachable but trustworthy
- **Neutral** - Doesn't add personality, lets content shine

**Sizes**: Generous, readable

- Never feels cramped or hard to read
- Hierarchy is clear but not dramatic
- Comfortable line spacing for easy reading

---

## Interaction Feeling

### Animations

**Smooth & Gentle**

- 0.2s transitions feel natural, not rushed
- Subtle hover effects (slight lift, soft shadow)
- No jarring movements or sudden changes

**Purposeful**

- Every animation has a reason
- Helps users understand what's happening
- Feels polished, not flashy

### Hover States

**Inviting, Not Demanding**

- Buttons lift slightly—"I'm ready when you are"
- Borders glow softly—"I'm here if you need me"
- Never aggressive or urgent

---

## The Complete Experience

When a user encounters ThinkTwice, the visual language should tell this story:

1. **"This is different"** - The dark, calm overlay stands apart from the bright Amazon page
2. **"This is safe"** - Soft colors and gentle interactions feel non-threatening
3. **"You're in control"** - Clear options, no pressure, your choice
4. **"This is thoughtful"** - Every element invites reflection, not reaction
5. **"This respects you"** - Privacy-focused, user-first, transparent

The style should make users think: _"Finally, a tool that treats me like an adult and helps me make better decisions without being preachy or pushy."_

---

## What This Style Is NOT

To maintain clarity, this style explicitly avoids:

- ❌ **Bright, urgent colors** (reds, oranges for primary actions)
- ❌ **Aggressive language** ("STOP!" "DON'T BUY!")
- ❌ **Corporate or salesy aesthetics**
- ❌ **Cluttered or overwhelming layouts**
- ❌ **Judgmental or preachy tone**
- ❌ **Dark patterns** (fake urgency, scarcity tactics)
- ❌ **Overly playful or childish** (we respect the user's intelligence)

---

## The Goal

Every design decision should answer: **"Does this help the user feel calm, empowered, and thoughtful?"**

If the answer is yes, it fits the ThinkTwice style.

If the answer is no—if it feels urgent, pushy, judgmental, or manipulative—it doesn't belong.

_This style guide is about feeling, not just pixels. Use it to make decisions that align with ThinkTwice's core mission: helping people make thoughtful choices with dignity and respect._
