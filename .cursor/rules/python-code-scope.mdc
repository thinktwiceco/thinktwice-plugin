# Python Code Generation Scope Rule

You are working on the Maurice3 project. **STRICTLY ENFORCE** this code generation scope rule for all Python files:

## CRITICAL CODE SCOPE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. Minimal Implementation Only
- **ONLY** implement exactly what is requested
- **NEVER** add extra features, methods, or functionality without explicit request
- **NEVER** add "helpful" additions that weren't asked for
- **NEVER** implement complete solutions when partial implementation is requested

### 2. Permission Required for Additions
- **ALWAYS** ask permission before adding anything beyond the core request
- **DISCUSS** whether additional code is appropriate before implementing
- **NEVER** add code without user consent, even if it seems logical or helpful
- **STOP** and ask if unsure about scope boundaries

### 3. Scope Boundaries
- **FOCUS** only on the specific function, method, or class mentioned
- **DO NOT** implement related functionality unless specifically requested  
- **DO NOT** add imports, dependencies, or utilities unless essential for the core request
- **DO NOT** add error handling, logging, or validation unless asked

### 4. Examples of What NOT to Add

❌ **NEVER add without permission:**
- Additional methods to a class when only one method was requested
- Extra validation or error handling beyond the basic requirement
- Logging, monitoring, or debugging code
- Helper functions or utilities not directly needed
- Documentation beyond basic docstrings for the requested code
- Test files or test cases
- Configuration or setup code
- Import statements beyond what's strictly necessary

✅ **ONLY implement:**
- The exact function, method, or class requested
- Basic docstring for the requested code
- Essential imports required for the specific functionality
- Minimal error handling if the code would break without it

### 5. When in Doubt
- **ASK**: "Should I also add [specific functionality]?"
- **DISCUSS**: "Would it be appropriate to include [specific feature]?"
- **CONFIRM**: "Do you want me to implement just [core request] or also [additional item]?"

## EXAMPLES

### ❌ BAD - Adding Too Much
```
User: "Add a create_user function"
Assistant: Creates create_user + update_user + delete_user + user validation + error handling + logging
```

### ✅ GOOD - Exact Scope
```
User: "Add a create_user function"  
Assistant: Creates only create_user function with basic implementation and docstring
```

### ✅ GOOD - Asking Permission
```
User: "Add a create_user function"
Assistant: "I'll implement the create_user function. Should I also add basic input validation, or just the core creation logic?"
```

## ENFORCEMENT

- **EVERY** code generation task must follow this rule
- **QUESTION** the scope before implementing if unclear
- **PREFER** under-implementation over over-implementation
- **REMEMBER**: The user can always ask for more, but removing unwanted code is wasteful

This rule applies to **ALL** Python files in the Maurice3 project without exception.
